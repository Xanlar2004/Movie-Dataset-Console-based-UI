     &emsp;d. Print the Number of Entities Listed<br>
     2. Sort the Entities<br>
     &emsp;a. Based on Any Field<br>
     &emsp;b. In Any Order (ASC, DESC)<br>
     3. Search Entity(ies) Based on Given Field and Value<br>

<h2>Movie Dataset Console-based UI</h2>
 <p>Inputs and Outputs Format: The program will take inputs and display results in a specific format, and users should provide inputs accordingly.<br>
    Interactive Menu: The menu will be interactive, allowing users to perform a sequence of requests.<br>
    Reusability: The program will return a collection of results after each request or sub-request, increasing reusability for subsequent requests.<br>
    Use of Java Concepts: The project will utilize various Java concepts, such as collections, functional interfaces, exception handling, file reading, OOP principles, LocalDate and     LocalTime classes, enums, etc.<br>
    Error Handling: The program will display user-friendly error messages instead of printing stack traces for exceptions.<br></p>
